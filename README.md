# MergeScript
It reads 1 csv and rewrites the lines in another, it takes the lines based on the raceID filter that you set and will overlap the lines in the second csv (I used it to merge the old races in HD in my race dbcs custom) possible to edit columns and filter to use different dbcs settings 

open script and change:\
input_file_name \
output_file_name \
temp_file_name
